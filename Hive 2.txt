Q1. Is it possible to use same meta store by multiple users in case of embedded Hive, if no then
why?
Ans:No, it is not possible to use metastore in sharing mode. It is recommended to use standalone “real” database like MySQL or PostGresSQL.
Q2. What is SerDe in Hive?
Ans:A SerDe is a short name for a Serializer Deserializer. Hive uses SerDe (and FileFormat) to read and write data from tables. 
An important concept behind Hive is that it DOES NOT own the Hadoop File System (HDFS) format that data is stored in. 
Users are able to write files to HDFS with whatever tools/mechanism takes their fancy(“CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE” or “LOAD DATA INPATH,” ) and use Hive to correctly 
“parse” that file format in a way that can be used by Hive. 
A SerDe is a powerful (and customizable) mechanism that Hive uses to “parse” data stored in HDFS to be used by Hive.

Q3. What is the functionality of query processor in Apache Hive?
Ans:This component implements the processing framework for converting SQL to a graph of map/reduce jobs 
and the execution time framework to run those jobs in the order of dependencies.

Q4. How can Hive avoid MapReduce?
Ans:If we set the property hive.exec.mode.local.auto to true then hive will avoid mapreduce to fetch query results.
Q5. What are the types of table in Hive?
Ans:Managed tables or sometimes called internal ,External Table
Q6. Does Hive support record level insert, delete or update?
Ans:No
Q7. What are the binary storage formats supported in Hive?
Ans:It can support Binary data files stored in RCFile and SequenceFile formats containing data serialized in Binary JSON, Avro, ProtoBuf 
and other binary formats.
Q8. What is the difference between external table and internal table in Hive? 
Ans:
Internal Table :
1).Hive stores the data of internal tables in a subdirectory under the directory defined by
hive.metastore.warehouse.dir (e.g., /user/hive/warehouse), by default.
2).When we drop a internal table, Hive deletes the data in the table.

External Table
1.)The EXTERNAL keyword tells Hive this table is external and the LOCATION … clause is
required to tell Hive where it’s located
2.)When dropping the External table does not delete the data, although the metadata for the table will be deleted .
