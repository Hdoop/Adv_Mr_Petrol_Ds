Ans:
pdata =load 'sample_data' Using PigStorage(',') As (Id: chararray,DistName: chararray:BuyRate: chararray,SellRate:chararray,
VolumeOut: int ,VolumeIn: int,Year: int);

group_data =group pdata by DistName;

total_petrol_sold =foreach group_data generate group as DistName,SUM(pdata.VolumeOut) As TotalSale;

dump total_petrol_sold;


Q2. Which are the top 10 distributers ID's for selling petrol? Also display the amount of
petrol sold in volume.
Ans:
pdata =load 'sample_data' Using PigStorage(',') As (Id: chararray,DistName: chararray:BuyRate: chararray,SellRate:chararray,
VolumeOut: int ,VolumeIn: int,Year: int);

group_data =group pdata by Id

total_petrol_sold_id =foreach group_data generate group as DistName,SUM(pdata.VolumeOut) As TotalSale;
order_desc =Order total_petrol_sold_id by TotalSale desc;

top_ten =Limit order_desc 10;

dump top_ten;
Q3.List 10 years where consumption of petrol is more with the distributer id who sold it?
Ans:
pdata =load 'sample_data' Using PigStorage(',') As (Id: chararray,DistName: chararray:BuyRate: chararray,SellRate:chararray,
VolumeOut: int ,VolumeIn: int,Year: int);

group_data =group pdata by Year;

total_petrol_sold_year =foreach group_data generate group as Year,SUM(pdata.VolumeOut) As TotalSale;
order_desc =Order total_petrol_sold_year by TotalSale desc;

top_ten_sale_year =Limit order_desc 10;

dump top_ten_sale_year ;

Q4.Find the distributer name who sold petrol in least amount?
Ans:
data =load 'sample_data' Using PigStorage(',') As (Id: chararray,DistName: chararray:BuyRate: chararray,SellRate:chararray,

group_data =group pdata by DistName;

total_petrol_sold_id =foreach group_data generate group as DistName,SUM(pdata.VolumeOut) As TotalSale;
order_desc =Order total_petrol_sold_id by TotalSale asc;

top_one =Limit order_desc 1;

dump top_out;
